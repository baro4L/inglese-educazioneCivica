            <h1>Gender Equality</h1>
            <img src="img/5.png" alt="Immagine Obiettivo" class="immagine-obiettivo">

            <p>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful,
                prosperous and sustainable world. There has been progress over the last decades, but the world is not on
                track to achieve gender equality by 2030.</p>
            <p>Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and therefore also half of its potential. But
                gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress.</p>

                    <h3>How much progress have we made?</h3>
                    <p>Some progress has been made in gender equality, like fewer child marriages and more women in
                        politics. However, true equality is still out of reach, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made
                        things even harder for women and girls.</p>

                <div class="sotto-sezione">
                    <h3>Why should gender equality matter to me?</h3>
                    <p>No matter where you live, gender equality is a basic human right. It helps make society better by
                        reducing poverty and improving health, education, safety, and well-being for both girls and
                        boys.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sotto-sezione">
                    <h3>What can we do?</h3>
                    <p>If you’re a girl, you can stay in school, encourage your classmates to do the same, and stand up
                        for your right to access healthcare and support. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If you’re a woman, you can challenge hidden biases and stereotypes that make it harder for women
                        to have the same opportunities as men.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re a man or a boy, you can work together with women and girls to create a fairer world
                        and build healthy, respectful relationships.
