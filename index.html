            <h2>We Refugees</h2>
            <p>
                I come from a musical place<br>
                Where they shoot me for my song<br>
                And my brother has been tortured<br>
                By my brother in my land.<br>
                <br>
                I come from a beautiful place<br>
                Where they hate my shade of skin<br>
                They don’t like the way I pray<br>
                And they ban free poetry.<br>
                <br>
                I come from a beautiful place<br>
                Where girls cannot go to school<br>
                There you are told what to believe<br>
                And even young boys must grow beards.<br>
                <br>
                I come from a great old forest<br>
                I think it is now a field<br>
                And the people I once knew<br>
                Are not there now.<br>
                <br>
                We can all be refugees<br>
                Nobody is safe,<br>
                All it takes is a mad leader<br>
                Or no rain to bring forth food,<br>
                We can all be refugees<br>
                We can all be told to go,<br>
                We can be hated by someone<br>
                For being someone.<br>
                <br>
                I come from a beautiful place<br>
                Where the valley floods each year<br>
                And each year the hurricane tells us<br>
                That we must keep moving on.<br>
                <br>
                I come from an ancient place<br>
                All my family were born there<br>
                And I would like to go there<br>
                But I really want to live.<br>
                <br>
                I come from a sunny, sandy place<br>
                Where tourists go to darken skin<br>
                And dealers like to sell guns there<br>
                I just can’t tell you what’s the price.<br>
                <br>
                I am told I have no country now<br>
                I am told I am a lie<br>
                I am told that modern history books<br>
                May forget my name.<br>
                <br>
                We can all be refugees<br>
                Sometimes it only takes a day,<br>
                Sometimes it only takes a handshake<br>
                Or a paper that is signed.<br>
                We all came from refugees<br>
                Nobody simply just appeared,<br>
                Nobody’s here without a struggle,<br>
                And why should we live in fear<br>
                Of the weather or the troubles?<br>
                We all came here from somewhere.<br>

                <p>
                    <b>Dr. Benjamin Zephaniah</b>, born in Birmingham, England, is a poet, musician, and activist known
                    for
                    blending Jamaican Dub Poetry with political themes. Leaving school at 13, he gained local fame in
                    Handsworth before moving to London, where his first book, <b>Pen Rhythm</b>, was published.
                    <br><br>
                    In the 1980s, he became a key voice in protests against racism, police brutality, and social
                    injustice, using poetry to reach mainstream audiences. He later performed worldwide, collaborated
                    with <b>The Wailers</b> in tribute to Nelson Mandela, and mixed Reggae, Hip Hop, and Jazz in his
                    music.
                    <br><br>
                    His children’s poetry (<i>Talking Turkeys</i>) and teen novels (<i>Face</i>) tackled real-world
                    issues, inspiring
                    young writers. With 16 honorary doctorates, a hospital wing named after him, and a global impact,
                    Zephaniah remains dedicated to <b>activism, poetry, and human rights.</b>

                    <h3>No Poverty</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The poem describes refugees forced to leave their homes due to war, persecution, or
                            environmental disasters.</li>
                        <li>The lines <i>"We can all be refugees, nobody is safe"</i> and <i>"Sometimes it only takes a
                                handshake or a paper that is signed"</i> emphasize how quickly people can lose
                            everything.</li>

                    <h3>Zero Hunger</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The line <i>"Or no rain to bring forth food"</i> points to food insecurity caused by
                            drought.</li>
                        <li>The poem highlights how people are forced to move when they can no longer grow food due to

                    <ul>
                        <li>The line "Where girls cannot go to school" directly addresses the lack of access to
                            education, particularly for girls in certain regions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Education is a key factor in breaking cycles of poverty and oppression, but many children,
                            especially girls, are denied this right.

                        <li>
                            The poem references restrictions placed on girls and women, such as "Where girls cannot go to school"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In some places, cultural or political forces prevent women from accessing education, work,
                            or personal freedom.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gender discrimination is deeply tied to poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities.

                            The line "I am told I have no country now / I am told I am a lie" reflects the harsh reality
                            of stateless people and those whose identities are denied.

            <h2>The use of Artificial intelligence</h2>
            <p>We used artificial intelligence as a support for some parts of the project, but without relying on it too
                much. <br> It helped us create an initial structure for the page’s style, making it easier to organize the
                website. 
            </p>
            <p>We also used it to explore the connections between the poem We Refugees and some of the Agenda 2030
                goals, helping us analyze the main themes. 
            </p>
            <p> However, the development and analysis were done independently,
                with AI used only as a tool for support.
